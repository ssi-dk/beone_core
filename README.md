# Initial setup 

## Pre-requisites

In order to build and run locally, you will need the following utilities:

* bash
* make
* pip3
* yarn
* docker
* docker-compose

Install the provided pre-commit hooks to get project-wide autoformatting and 
linting.

```shell
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

# Running
To run locally using `docker-compose`, execute:

```shell
make run
```

This will launch all containers with locally mounted files, enabling automatic code reload, 
as well as hot-module-reload (HMR) in the browser.

## Local dev running
Create virtual env, install dependencies
```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ . .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Have a mongodb instance running on localhost:27017

```shell
$ sh start_local.sh
```

On windows, in venv with dependencies installed
```shell
set FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
set FLASK_DEBUG=1
set APP_CONFIG_FILE=config.py
set FLASK_RUN_HOST=127.0.0.1
set FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080
flask run
```

# Generating simulated data
When running locally, the bifrost db gets pre-seeded with the contents of the `.jsonl` files inside `initdb.d`.

These `.jsonl` files can be regenerated based on the latest specification running:

```shell
rm bifrost/bifrost_db/initdb.d/generated.jsonl
./generate_dummy_data.sh
```

The seeding only occurs when the database is first created, so to force the change to take effect, run:

```shell
make clean && make run
```
